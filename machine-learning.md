# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a rapidly growing field with many application in physics. Here, I write about machine learning.
Currently, I don't have a specific plan to what to write on this page, thus I write what I find interesting.

## Machine Learning at the LHC
The Inter-experimental Machine Learning (**IML**) Working Group provides a forum for machine learning community at the LHC. Further information is in the [IML website](https://www.iml.web.cern.ch). There are some [public datasets](https://iml.web.cern.ch/public-datasets) to build and test  machine learning models.

I have worked on Top tagging. Top is the heaviest quark which almost always decays promptly to a W boson and b quark. To reconstruct a top quark we can find a W boson and a b jet. However, if the produced top quark is boosted its decay products are not separable and therefore we need some data analysis techniques to distinguishe a boost top quark from an ordinary jet. This problem is very exciting and it can help physcists to test some of the theoretical models. [Top Tagging Reference Dataset](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hcuc6LBxZNX16zjEGeq16DAzspkDC4nDTyjMp1bWHRo/edit) has a document states how to download dataset and what are the best scores.

## Machine Learning in Dark Matter

[Dark Machines](http://darkmachines.org/) is a new collaboration which wants to solve the mysteries of dark matter with data science and machine learning techniques.
There is an [indico](https://indico.cern.ch/category/10285/) page for Dark Machine collaboration. In addition, they have a twitter account [@dark_machines](https://twitter.com/dark_machines) posting related information.
